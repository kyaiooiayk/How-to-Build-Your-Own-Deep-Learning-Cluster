# How to build yout own Deep Learning cluster
This is an account of what I've read/done/followed to build my own deep learning cluster. Hopefully, it would be of some help for the others.

## What was my background?
I consider myself an engineer turned into a mix of software developer, CFD engineer, optimisation engineer, system engineer and data scientist. I had next-to-nothing experience on how hardware. If I did, you can also do it. The  only thing this tutorial is not going to provide you with is the capital to buy the component.

## My  goal?
I'd like to:
- Learn a bit more about the hardware needed to run a DL network
- Improve some of mine coding skills
- Have the abality to use the cluster when I want to with no restriction
- Use it as a part of my portfolio as a Data Scientist (I know what you  are thinking!? This has nothing to do with Data Science! I agree with you, but I also true that being completely ingorant on the matter is equally bad! So, here I am.)
- Have a bit of fun doing it.

## Some very high level questions
This a list of question I had to answer myself before  spending my own money.
-  Is this project going to make bankrupt either buying the hardware or running the machine?
-  Can I run the two major deep learning frameworks withouth getting stuck into a "sorry, this hardware is currently not supported!"
-  How many CPUs and GPUs do I need?
-  How many CPPs and GPUs can I afford?
-  Can I buy some second hand components?
-  How dangerous are these machines in terms of fire safety? What if my cooling system fails and I am not there to turn the machine off?
-  Can I get the same level of lfexibility from freely avaiilable resource such as Google Colab?
-  How much support can I get from the internet?
